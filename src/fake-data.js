        "body": "# 🚀 feature request\r\n\r\n### Relevant Package\r\nThis feature request is for @angular/router\r\n\r\n\r\n### Disclaimer\r\nThis feature request can be broken down to several separate issues (bugs and FRs) but I've decided to create one issue to describe my actual use case, problems I have encountered, ideal solution I'd like to have and workaround I came up with.\r\n\r\n### Use case\r\nI'm working on web site for reading books. I have some \"reader\" page with infinite scroll that loads next chapter when user scrolls near to of a page. When some chapter enters view-port, I change browser URL to this chapter without triggering navigation (using `Location.replaceState`). \r\n\r\nIf users scroll to some next chapter and then reload page or go back/forward in history, they lost scroll position, because saved scroll position (on page with several chapters) is greater then reloaded page length (on page with only \"last\" chapter)\r\n\r\nThe idea was to use `history.state` to save scroll position relative to current chapter top.\r\n\r\n### Problems\r\nSaving position was pretty straightforward, because `Location.replaceState` method already has state property. But restoring this state is a pain.\r\n\r\nThanks to #27198 router already knows something about history state, current design/implementation isn't enough do described use case. I didn't figure out why we need both `NavigationStart.restoredState` and `NavigationExtras.state`, but despite similar description, they are not the same. \r\n\r\nRouter itself lacks public method that behaves like `Location.replaceState` (#24617), and any \"outside\" changes to `history.state` are not available as `NavigationExtras.state` of `Router.getCurrentNavigation()`, but only available as `NavigationStart.restoredState`. There is private `setBrowserUrl` method, that can be used for public implementation.\r\n\r\n`NavigationStart.restoredState` of initial page load can't be reached inside component that is responsible for text rendering (i.e. in the place, which knows chapter top offset, where we need to add saved scroll position), because initial `NavigationStart` is fired before any component (except of `AppComponent`) is created. And there is no way to get this value otherwise, except of catching it in `AppComponent` and saving in some service.\r\n\r\nBuy the way workaround from https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/27198#issuecomment-453789450 to pass `NavigationStart.restoredState` as `NavigationExtras.state` doesn't work (any more?) because of resetting `currentNavigation` [here](https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/7.2.6/packages/router/src/router.ts#L711) in case of \"redirect during NavigationStart\".\r\n\r\nAnd even if we can get `NavigationStart.restoredState` in such hackish way, there is no sense to do this, because of bug. We don't get load any stored state from history in initial navigation (see `null` in [line 951](https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/7.2.6/packages/router/src/router.ts#L951) called from [line 778](https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/7.2.6/packages/router/src/router.ts#L778))\r\n\r\nActually we don't even have a way to get this initial state, because all classes on the way from `Location`, through `LocationStrategy`, `PathLocationStrategy`, `PlatformLocation`, `BrowserPlatformLocation` up to `History` lacks an abstraction to get current state.\r\n\r\nHopefully we still can access `window.history.state` directly. But again, we cann't do it in the component code, because before we create component, router already resets saves `history.state` with `{navigationId:1}`. So I still need to write some hackish way to store this value somewhere before first `ActivationStart` event.\r\n\r\n### Describe the solution you'd like\r\nI'd like to have a way to straightforwardly call something on router to replace current state and than be able to get this state in `Scroll` router event. I want this state to be persistently saved even after page reload to moving back/forward outside of angular application. \r\n\r\nI don't really care how it will be implemented internally, but just fixing problems above should be enough.\r\n\r\nRouter should have it's own `replaceState` (or something) method, that encapsulate any logic around  `Location.replaceState` to handle `navigationId` or any other possible future angular-specific internal structure of `history.state` (#27607) and also to provide state as `NavigationExtras.state` instead of `NavigationStart.restoredState`.\r\n\r\n### Describe alternatives you've considered\r\nThis section is mostly for someone looking for solution for exactly my use case. \r\nWorkaround I came up with consists of two parts. \r\nFirst - I use resolver to get saved data directly from `window.history.state`.\r\nSecond - because of the same reason I can get data on initial page load - I receive wrong data on navigating away to another chapter. What do I mean? Consider following use case:\r\n- Initial page load without history. \r\n- No data in history -> no scrolling to position.\r\n- Scroll a bit, position is saved to history.\r\n- Reload page. \r\n- Router will rewrite history only on ActivationStart, so we get correct data in resolver. \r\n- There is data from resolver -> scroll to saved position.\r\n- Scroll a bit, position is saved to history.\r\n- Navigate to another chapter directly (there is contents feature in my app). \r\n- _Router will rewrite history only on ActivationStart_, so we get **incorrect** data of previous chapter in resolver.\r\n- There is data from resolver -> we scroll to incorrect saved position of previous chapter.\r\n\r\nTo workaround this problem, I save chapter id together with scroll position, so I can check is this data is relevant.\r\nFinal code looks something like this:\r\n\r\nprogress-resolver.service.ts:\r\n```TypeScript\r\nimport { Inject, Injectable, PLATFORM_ID } from '@angular/core';\r\nimport { isPlatformBrowser } from \"@angular/common\";\r\nimport { ActivatedRouteSnapshot, Resolve, RouterStateSnapshot } from \"@angular/router\";\r\n\r\ninterface Progress {\r\n  scroll: number,\r\n  chapterId: number,\r\n}\r\n\r\n@Injectable({\r\n  providedIn: 'root'\r\n})\r\nexport class ProgressResolverService implements Resolve<Progress | null> {\r\n\r\n  constructor(@Inject(PLATFORM_ID) private platformId: Object) {\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  resolve(route: ActivatedRouteSnapshot, state: RouterStateSnapshot): Progress | null {\r\n    if (isPlatformBrowser(this.platformId) && window && window.history && window.history.state && window.history.state.progress) {\r\n      return {\r\n        scroll: window.history.state.scroll,\r\n        chapterId: window.history.state.chapterId,\r\n      };\r\n    }\r\n    return null;\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nchapter-text.component.ts:\r\n```TypeScript\r\nimport { AfterViewInit, Component, ElementRef, Input, OnDestroy, ViewChild } from '@angular/core';\r\nimport { OnScrollService } from \"../on-scroll/on-scroll.service\";\r\nimport { ActivatedRoute } from \"@angular/router\";\r\nimport { Location, ViewportScroller } from \"@angular/common\";\r\nimport { debounceTime, filter, map } from \"rxjs/operators\";\r\nimport { Subscription } from \"rxjs\";\r\n\r\n@Component({\r\n  selector: 'app-chapter-text',\r\n  templateUrl: './chapter-text.component.html',\r\n  styleUrls: ['./chapter-text.component.scss']\r\n})\r\nexport class ChapterTextComponent implements OnDestroy, AfterViewInit {\r\n  @Input() chapter: any;\r\n  private progressSub: Subscription;\r\n  private subscription: Subscription;\r\n  private position: { top: number; height: number };\r\n\r\n  constructor(\r\n    private elem: ElementRef,\r\n    private route: ActivatedRoute,\r\n    private onScroll: OnScrollService,\r\n    private location: Location,\r\n    private viewportScroller: ViewportScroller,\r\n  ) {\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  ngAfterViewInit() {\r\n    this.position = {\r\n      top: this.elem.nativeElement.offsetTop,\r\n      height: this.elem.nativeElement.offsetHeight\r\n    };\r\n    this.subscribe();\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  subscribe() {\r\n    this.subscription = this.onScroll.scroll.pipe(\r\n      filter(scroll => this.position.top < scroll && scroll < this.position.top + this.position.height),\r\n      debounceTime(100),\r\n    ).subscribe(scroll => this.location.replaceState(this.chapter.url, undefined, {\r\n      ...window.history.state,\r\n      scroll,\r\n      chapterId: this.chapter.chapterId\r\n    }));\r\n    \r\n    this.progressSub = this.route.data.pipe(\r\n      map(data => data.progress),\r\n      filter(progress => progress && this.chapter.chapterId == progress.chapterId),\r\n      map(progress => progress.scroll),\r\n    ).subscribe(scroll => this.viewportScroller.scrollToPosition([0, scroll]));\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  ngOnDestroy() {\r\n    this.subscription.unsubscribe();\r\n    this.progressSub.unsubscribe();\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n"

It is often\r\nnecessary to retrieve the correct type of element from the location\r\nwhich means that we often have to wrap the arrays. Logically it makes\r\nmore sense if the thing  which we are wrapping is at `0` location. Also\r\nit may be more performant since data is more local which may result in\r\nmore L2 cache hits in CPU.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nrefactor(ivy): simplify differentiation of LView, `RNode`, `LView`, `LContainer`, `StylingContext`\r\n\r\nFor efficiency reasons we often put several different data types (`RNode`, `LView`, `LContainer`,\r\n`StylingContext`) in same location in `LView`. This is because we don't want to pre-allocate\r\nspace\r\nfor it because the storage is sparse. This file contains utilities for dealing with such data\r\ntypes.\r\nHow do we know what is stored at a given location in `LView`.\r\n- `Array.isArray(value) === false` => `RNode` (The normal storage value)\r\n- `Array.isArray(value) === true` => than the `value[0]` represents the wrapped value.\r\n  - `typeof value[TYPE] === 'object'` => `LView`\r\n     - This happens when we have a component at a given location\r\n  - `typeof value[TYPE] === 'number'` => `StylingContext`\r\n     - This happens when we have style/class binding at a given location.\r\n  - `typeof value[TYPE] === true` => `LContainer`\r\n     - This happens when we have `LContainer` binding at a given location.\r\nNOTE: it is assumed that `Array.isArray` and `typeof` operations are very efficient.\r\n\r\n## PR Checklist\r\nPlease check if your PR fulfills the following requirements:\r\n\r\n- [ ] The commit message follows our guidelines: https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#commit\r\n- [ ] Tests for the changes have been added (for bug fixes / features)\r\n- [ ] Docs have been added / updated (for bug fixes / features)\r\n\r\n\r\n## PR Type\r\nWhat kind of change does this PR introduce?\r\n\r\n<!-- Please check the one that applies to this PR using \"x\". -->\r\n\r\n- [ ] Bugfix\r\n- [ ] Feature\r\n- [ ] Code style update (formatting, local variables)\r\n- [ ] Refactoring (no functional changes, no api changes)\r\n- [ ] Build related changes\r\n- [ ] CI related changes\r\n- [ ] Documentation content changes\r\n- [ ] angular.io application / infrastructure changes\r\n- [ ] Other...

But `ngOnDestroy` is not called if module is destroyed:\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/905328/53258045-efbe5500-36cb-11e9-9c96-77f8c1da40bf.png)\r\n\r\nThis is currently an issue for as as we try to use angular/universal, but we can't tear down objects in services when provided in root.\r\n"

Custom UrlSerializer:  but this seems unreasonably difficult for  an average user to investigate and implement.\r\n"
